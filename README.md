# Portal Adventure Code

This most of the code that I wrote for the game Portal Adventure this is by no means all of the code since I removed API related code such Google API, ICloud and, Unity Services API code for security purposes. I also did not add any game assets since the Repo would be a way to big.

* It was fun making the game. I learend a lot about game development and cs oop programming.

## Notes

* Most of the code is undocumented this is because i was the sole develeoper of this project.
